# 🌍 Rater X — Making AI Hear Africa

Welcome to **Rater X**, where we're on a mission to revolutionize AI in Africa by building powerful, affordable, and culturally relevant models and datasets for African languages—starting with Nigerian Pidgin, Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo.

> **“Making AI Hear Africa.”**

---

## 🚀 Our Mission

AI should **understand, respond to, and represent African voices**. Today, most AI systems are built for English or other global languages, leaving millions of African users misunderstood or ignored.

At Rater X, we're closing that gap by creating **high-quality AI data and models** for African languages, beginning with Nigeria and expanding across the continent.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

### 1. Bridge the AI Language Gap

We build AI tools—like **sentiment analysis**, **speech-to-text (STT)**, and **text-to-speech (TTS)**—that **understand African languages** natively.

- ✅ 7,000+ labeled Pidgin sentences
- ✅ Pidgin sentiment model (85%+ accuracy)
- ✅ 500+ audio clips for TTS/STT
- ➡️ Expanding to Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo, Swahili, Zulu, and Oromo

### 2. Empower African Startups with Affordable AI

We offer **ready-to-use AI starter packs** that save startups weeks of development and thousands in cost.

- 🧠 Pre-trained sentiment models
- 🎧 Audio datasets for Pidgin speech
- 🧰 Tools that plug directly into startup workflows

Use cases:
- **Kuda** → Pidgin-native customer service bots
- **Jumia** → Voice assistants that understand phrases like “Wetin dey happen?”

### 3. Become Africa’s #1 AI Data Provider by 2027

By 2027, Rater X will:
- Cover **200M+ African language speakers**
- Offer **automated multi-agent data labeling**
- Scale to **20K+ labeled samples/month**
- Become the **go-to AI partner** for African and global companies entering African markets

## 🌱 Current Project: Pidgin AI Starter Pack (April–June 2025)

- 🎯 **Sentiment Analysis Model** (85%+ accuracy) — Completed April 30
- 🎧 **500 Audio Clips for TTS/STT** — Due May 15
- 📦 **Starter Pack Launch** — May 2025

Helping African startups build:
- Chatbots that understand local slang and sentiment
- Voice assistants that speak the language of the people

## 🌍 Our Vision for the Future

### 🌐 Pan-African AI Ecosystem

We aim to create an **ecosystem of data, tools, and community** that drives innovation across fintech, e-commerce, education, and healthcare in Africa.

Imagine:
- A **Pidgin Siri**
- A **Hausa customer service bot**
- A **Swahili health app**
- A **Yoruba learning assistant**

### 💼 Economic Empowerment

African startups often lack the data and technical resources to train language-specific models. We level the playing field by:

- Providing affordable, high-quality AI tools
- Reducing time to market from months to weeks
- Helping startups serve users in their native languages

### 🌎 Global Impact, African Roots

Rater X is born in Nigeria but built for the world. By 2027, we will partner with global companies seeking to expand into African markets—**with data and models built by Africans, for Africans**.
